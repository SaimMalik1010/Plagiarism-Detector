# Plagiarism-Detector
Plagiarism Detector will analyze all .txt  .pdf and .docx files in a folder, compare every file with every other file, and report groups of files whose similarity exceeds a given threshold.
It uses a Sentence-BERT algorithm along with Similarity Cosine function to identify the similarity between the documents by comparing the words' semantics instead of matching it word-to-word
