# Plagiarism-Detector
Core Functionality — What We Have
1. File types: .txt, .docx, .pdf.

2. Empty file handling.

3. Chunking → captures partial plagiarism.

4. Sentence-BERT embeddings → semantic similarity.

5. N-gram checks (on suspicious chunks) → catches verbatim copying.

6. Pairwise similarity table → average similarity shown for all pairs.

7. Detailed match breakdown → only for flagged pairs.
